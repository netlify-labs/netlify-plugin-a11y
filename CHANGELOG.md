## [v1.0.0-alpha.5](https://github.com/netlify-labs/netlify-plugin-a11y/compare/v1.0.0-alpha.4...v1.0.0-alpha.5)

### Added
- New input: `ignoreElements`. Used to indicate to the test runner elements which should be ignored during a11y testing.
### Changed

### Changed
- Added a pre-release notice to the README, as well as other copy cleanup.
